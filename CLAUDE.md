# THE VAULT — Claude Code Project Guide

A fitness / workout-tracking **PWA**. Vanilla JS, **no build step**, bilingual **EN/AR** (RTL), dark-themed, mobile-first. Deployed to GitHub Pages and wrapped as an Android app via Capacitor.

- **Live:** https://moathdarweesh.github.io/vault/ (GitHub Pages, branch `main`)
- **Repo:** github.com/moathdarweesh/vault

## Stack & key files
- `index.html` — markup, script wiring, and the cache-version markers.
- `js/app.js` (~190KB) — ALL views/rendering, the router `navigate(view, ctx, opts)`, and the two EN/AR translation objects. Use `Grep` to find a function; don't assume from names.
- `js/storage.js` — the `DB.*` localStorage API (all persistence). `MACHINE_SEED`, name-match migrations.
- `js/cloud.js` — Supabase email/password auth + whole-blob sync to a per-user `vault_data` row (RLS-protected). Uses the **publishable** key only (never service-role). Loads before app.js.
- `js/foodai.js` — AI calorie chat. Posts `{text}` to a **Cloudflare Worker** (`backend/gemini-worker.js`) that holds the Gemini key server-side. The key never ships to the client.
- `js/health.js` — Health Connect bridge (Capacitor, no-op on web).
- `styles.css` (~100KB) — one stylesheet; reuse existing CSS variables and classes.

## How to run & verify
- **Run:** `node dev-server.js` → http://localhost:8080 (serves `Cache-Control: no-store`). Honors `$PORT`. Also `.claude/launch.json` server name `vault` for the preview tool.
- **No automated test framework.** "Tested" = verified in the real running app by driving the DOM with `preview_eval`. **Screenshots time out on this app — do not rely on them.**

## Non-negotiable rules
- **Every user-facing string** goes through `t('key')` and has BOTH an EN and an AR entry in `app.js`. A missing language is a bug.
- **Read/write data only through `DB.*`** — never touch `localStorage` directly from view code.
- **Escape untrusted data** rendered into `innerHTML` with `escapeHtml()` — exercise/food names, and anything from cloud sync / imported backups / AI responses are untrusted.
- No new dependencies, no build step. Free-first (the maintainer prioritizes free tools/services).

## CACHE WORKFLOW (mandatory every release that changes shipped files)
Bump the version in **four** places in `index.html` + the label, or the change never reaches phones:
1. `?v=N` on every `<script>` tag.
2. `?v=N` on the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css?v=N">`.
3. The `__cleaned_vN` sessionStorage key in the inline cleanup script.
4. The visible build label `THE VAULT · vN` in `app.js`.
Then grep for the old number — zero matches should remain. **Current version: v81.**

## Deploy
- **Web:** commit + push to `main`; GitHub Pages auto-rebuilds.
- **Cloudflare Worker:** changes to `backend/gemini-worker.js` require a **manual redeploy** (Cloudflare → Edit code → paste → Deploy). CORS is locked to an origin allowlist — if the AI breaks on the Android app, add the Capacitor origin to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
- **Supabase:** schema/RLS changes in `backend/supabase-setup.sql` must be run in the Supabase SQL editor.
- **Android APK:** `npm run build:www && npx cap sync android && (cd android && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug)` → `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. Installed via Google Drive (delete the old APK first). Portable JDK/SDK live under `C:\Users\moath\at`.

## Feature factory
This machine has a `/feature-factory` skill (24 specialist subagents, tailored to THE VAULT) that builds a feature end-to-end. See the maintainer's Claude memory for the roster.
