# THE VAULT — Claude Code Project Guide

A fitness / workout-tracking **PWA**. Vanilla JS, **no build step**, bilingual **EN/AR** (RTL), dark-themed, mobile-first. Deployed to GitHub Pages and wrapped as an Android app via Capacitor.

- **Live:** https://moathdarweesh.github.io/vault/ (GitHub Pages, branch `main`)
- **Repo:** github.com/moathdarweesh/vault

## Stack & key files
- `index.html` — markup, script wiring, and the cache-version markers.
- `js/app.js` (~190KB) — ALL views/rendering, the router `navigate(view, ctx, opts)`, and the two EN/AR translation objects. Use `Grep` to find a function; don't assume from names.
- `js/storage.js` — the `DB.*` localStorage API (all persistence). `MACHINE_SEED`, name-match migrations.
- `js/cloud.js` — Supabase email/password auth + whole-blob sync to a per-user `vault_data` row (RLS-protected). Uses the **publishable** key only (never service-role). Loads before app.js. Also: `getUsername/checkUsername/setUsername` (the mandatory-handle feature) and `getClient` (for tables.js).
- `js/tables.js` — the **"mirror"**: additively projects the local blob into the normalized schema-v2 tables (best-effort, one-way, idempotent, RLS-scoped). Never affects local logging. Loads after storage.js. **⚠️ ADDITIVE-ONLY: it only upserts — it never DELETEs or writes `deleted_at`, so rows deleted locally live on in the tables. The mirror can therefore drift from the blob; it is analytics-only and NOT safe for the app to read back until delete/tombstone propagation + a reconcile pass are added** (flagged by the DB-department audit, 2026-07-11).
- `js/foodai.js` — AI calorie chat. Posts `{text}` to a **Cloudflare Worker** (`backend/gemini-worker.js`) that holds the Gemini key server-side. The key never ships to the client.
- `js/health.js` — Health Connect bridge (Capacitor, no-op on web).
- `js/update.js` — native-shell update checker. No-op on web (web is always latest via the live URL). On the APK it compares the installed `versionCode` (via `@capacitor/app` `App.getInfo().build`) against `version.json` → `apk.build`; if a newer APK exists, shows the dismissible "download" banner linking to Drive. Best-effort, never blocks the app.
- `version.json` (repo root) — the APK-shell update manifest read by `js/update.js`. Bump `apk.build`/`apk.url`/notes when you ship a NEW APK.
- `styles.css` (~100KB) — one stylesheet; reuse existing CSS variables and classes.
- `admin.html` — standalone owner-only **multi-center control console** (GitHub Pages, not in the APK). Owner logs in → `is_admin()` RLS unlocks reading every user. Sidebar centers: dashboard, users (search/sort + per-user drill-down + **role/status write controls**), analytics, catalog, feedback inbox, roles/admins, releases, export. Writes go only through the `is_admin()`-gated definer RPCs (`admin_set_role`/`admin_set_status`). Publishable key only — never a service_role key.

## How to run & verify
- **Run:** `node dev-server.js` → http://localhost:8080 (serves `Cache-Control: no-store`). Honors `$PORT`. Also `.claude/launch.json` server name `vault` for the preview tool.
- **No automated test framework.** "Tested" = verified in the real running app by driving the DOM with `preview_eval`. **Screenshots time out on this app — do not rely on them.**

## Non-negotiable rules
- **Every user-facing string** goes through `t('key')` and has BOTH an EN and an AR entry in `app.js`. A missing language is a bug.
- **Read/write data only through `DB.*`** — never touch `localStorage` directly from view code.
- **Escape untrusted data** rendered into `innerHTML` with `escapeHtml()` — exercise/food names, and anything from cloud sync / imported backups / AI responses are untrusted.
- No new dependencies, no build step. Free-first (the maintainer prioritizes free tools/services).

## CACHE WORKFLOW (mandatory every release that changes shipped files)
Bump the version in **five** places, or the change never reaches phones:
1. `?v=N` on every `<script>` tag in `index.html`.
2. `?v=N` on the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css?v=N">`.
3. The `__cleaned_vN` sessionStorage key in the inline cleanup script.
4. The visible build label `THE VAULT · vN` in `app.js`.
5. **`version.json` → `web: N`** — the auto-updater (`js/update.js`) reloads devices to this build. It MUST equal the `?v=N` above; if `web` is left behind, devices never update; if it is set ahead of the deployed `?v=N`, devices reload once per launch (guarded, not a brick) until fixed.
Then grep for the old number — zero matches should remain. **Current version: v135.** (The `app.js` build label and the feedback version tag both read the single `VAULT_BUILD` const at the top of `app.js` — bump that one const, not two literals.)

### Auto-update delivery (since v113) — how updates actually reach devices
The `?v=N` busting alone does NOT reach phones, because the **entry `index.html` itself** is HTTP-cached by GitHub Pages (`Cache-Control: max-age=600`) and the SPA/APK-WebView never re-fetches it while open. `js/update.js` fixes this: on boot it fetches `version.json` fresh (`no-store`), compares `web` to the page's own `?v=N` (parsed from the script src), and if newer **reloads the entry html with a `?u=<build>` cache-buster** → fresh index.html + fresh `?v=N` scripts. Runs on web AND inside the APK WebView. Four guards make a reload loop impossible (unknown-build no-op, `<=` no-op, url-already-`?u=`-targeted no-op, once-per-session `sessionStorage` guard). On resume it re-pulls admin content + shows a tap-to-update banner. **Bootstrap caveat:** a device only gains the auto-updater once it is already ON a build that has it (≥v113) — the first arrival of ≥v113 still relies on the 10-min HTTP cache expiring (or a manual hard-refresh / clear-cache). Every update after that is automatic within seconds of app open.
- **Admin announcement** (`app_config.announcement_*`): shown by `showAnnouncementBanner`. Dismissal is keyed on the config's `updated_at`, so **editing or re-saving the announcement in the admin panel re-broadcasts it to everyone**, even users who dismissed the previous one. `pullCatalog` selects `updated_at`; `init()` re-runs `bootCatalog` on foreground so a freshly-activated announcement appears without a restart.

## Deploy
- **Web:** commit + push to `main`; GitHub Pages auto-rebuilds.
- **Cloudflare Worker:** changes to `backend/gemini-worker.js` require a **manual redeploy** (Cloudflare → Edit code → paste → Deploy). CORS is locked to an origin allowlist — if the AI breaks on the Android app, add the Capacitor origin to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
- **Supabase:** schema/RLS changes in `backend/supabase-setup.sql` must be run in the Supabase SQL editor.
- **Android APK:** `npm run build:www && npx cap sync android && (cd android && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug)` → `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. Copied to Google Drive (`G:\ملفاتي`). Portable JDK/SDK live under `C:\Users\moath\at` (`JAVA_HOME=…\jdk\jdk-21.0.11+10`, `ANDROID_HOME=…\sdk`).

## Distribution model — Live URL + native-update banner (since v109)
`capacitor.config.json` sets `server.url = https://moathdarweesh.github.io/vault/`, so the **APK is a thin shell that loads the LIVE site**. Consequences:
- **Ordinary updates (JS/CSS/HTML) reach everyone automatically** on next app open, with NO reinstall — a `git push` updates web AND app users at once. The bundled `www/` is only a build artifact; it is ignored at runtime.
- The APK's WebView origin is now `https://moathdarweesh.github.io` (same as web) — the Worker CORS allowlist already includes it. **Needs internet at launch** (acceptable: the app is cloud/AI-dependent anyway).
- A **NEW APK is only needed for NATIVE changes** (new Capacitor plugin/permission, `capacitor.config`, native code). To ship one: bump `versionCode` in `android/app/build.gradle`, build, copy to Drive, then set `version.json` → `apk.build` to the new versionCode + `apk.url` to the Drive share link + notes, and push. Installed apps then show the in-app "download update" banner (`js/update.js`).
- Migration note: users upgrading from a pre-v109 (bundled) APK land on the new github.io origin, so localStorage/auth reset once → they log in again and cloud sync restores their data. New users are unaffected.

## Backend v2 — normalized DB, mirror, admin (APPLIED to live Supabase)
The app is going multi-user. Alongside the legacy `vault_data` blob (still the local-first source of truth), a **normalized schema** is live in Supabase (project ref `ilmusnuchqlpirywonzx`). SQL artifacts in `backend/`:
- `schema-v2.sql` — 16 core tables + full RLS + indexes (APPLIED). `seed-v2.sql` — global exercise/cardio catalog (APPLIED). `migrate-blob-to-v2.sql` — one-time blob→tables backfill, SECTION UP applied. `admin-v2.sql` — `profiles.username` (unique), `admins` registry + `is_admin()` + additive admin-READ policies on all tables + `username_available()` RPC (APPLIED).
- **Mirror** (`js/tables.js`): ongoing blob→tables projection on login/change.
- **Usernames**: mandatory unique `@handle` enforced by a blocking gate (app.js `ensureUsername`/`showUsernameGate`), set via the profiles table.
- **Admin**: the owner's user_id is in `admins`; `is_admin()` unlocks all-user reads via RLS (never a service_role key in any client). Powers `admin.html`.
- **Admin WRITE + user management** (`admin-write-v3.sql`, v110): `profiles.last_seen` (self-written activity stamp); `user_flags` (role user/coach/admin + status active/disabled/banned) — **admin-write-only via definer RPCs, no client write policy** so a user can read their own row but never escalate; `feedback` inbox (user inserts own, admin reads/resolves). Writes only through `admin_set_role`/`admin_set_status` (SECURITY DEFINER, re-check `is_admin()`, refuse self-target AND the founder owner id). App side (`js/cloud.js` `touchLastSeen`/`getMyFlags`/`submitFeedback`; `js/app.js` `enforceAccountStatus` + `showBlockedGate` + feedback form). **Ban is client-enforced (soft) — fails OPEN**; a hard RLS/auth-level ban is Roadmap. Security-audited (no isolation break, no escalation; feedback fields escaped in the inbox).
- **Applying SQL:** run in the Supabase SQL editor. The "destructive operations" dialog is benign ONLY when the script's drops are `drop policy/trigger if exists` guards; a real DROP/DELETE/TRUNCATE needs explicit human confirmation. See the maintainer's memory (`vault-db-v2`).
- **Content/presets/audit/config** (`admin-write-v4.sql`, v111, applied+verified): `audit_log` (append-only, admin-read) + `audit()` logger; `app_config` (public read); `food_catalog` + `preset_plans` (global, public read); is_admin-gated definer CRUD RPCs for global exercises/cardio/foods/presets/config. App consumes them additively via `Cloud.pullCatalog()`/`bootCatalog()` (`js/app.js`) + `DB.exercises.mergeGlobal()`.
- **DB-department audit (2026-07-11)** — full read-only review by db-architect + normalization-auditor + db-security-auditor + db-index-optimizer. Verdict: **professional (A-/B+); no Critical; no client-reachable isolation break; every table BCNF or justified; indexes ahead of the workload.** Fixes surfaced: `backend/hardening-v5.sql` (additive — `feedback_user_idx` + `vault_data` grant double-lock; **ready to apply, not yet applied**); `backend/DROP-migration_v2.CONFIRMATION-REQUIRED.sql` (**destructive** — the leftover `migration_v2` staging schema holds unminimized cross-user PII; NOT reachable but a data-min gap; human runs out-of-band after a backup). Roadmap/optional: consolidate `admins`↔`user_flags.role`; decompose `health_prefs.hidden text[]`→`health_hidden` before analytics; `loadAll()` → aggregate RPC as users grow; hard RLS ban.
- **Custom exercise images — durable backup** (`backend/storage-images-v6.sql`, **APPLIED + VERIFIED live 2026-07-17**; v120–v123): user-uploaded images (`customImage`) used to live ONLY as base64 inside the `vault_data` blob. The blob is a single mutable row with no history, so when an empty local state once overwrote it every image was destroyed — and the mirror never carried them, so a mirror restore brought back the exercise but not its picture (**this actually happened to the owner; the images were unrecoverable**). Now: the base64 STAYS in the blob (instant render + works offline in the gym — do not "optimise" this away), and a durable copy is ALSO uploaded to the **private** `exercise-images` bucket at `{auth.uid()}/{exercise_id}.jpg` (owner-only RLS on `storage.objects`, 5 MB cap, image mime allowlist — **keep `image/svg+xml` OUT of that allowlist permanently: it is what rejects an active-content SVG from a poisoned imported backup**). The pointer goes in the **existing** `user_exercise_prefs.custom_image_path` (schema-v2's designated field for exactly this bucket) — so the migration alters no table. `tables.js` writes it in a **separate upsert batch** from the `in_my_list` rows: an upsert writes every column in its payload, so a blob row with no path must never send `custom_image_path: null` and blank a pointer already on the server — that blind overwrite is the same bug class that destroyed the images. Client: `Cloud.backupExerciseImage/restoreExerciseImage/removeExerciseImage` (cloud.js), `backupExerciseImageFor()` on save + `syncExerciseImages()` after login/bootSync (app.js) which backfills any un-backed-up image AND heals an exercise whose base64 was lost but whose backup survived. **All best-effort** — every failure path leaves the local base64 untouched, so backing up can never lose an image, and the app works unchanged if the bucket is missing.
- Still pending: app doesn't READ from the new normalized tables yet (mirror is one-way + additive-only — see the tables.js note); social features deferred.

## Feature factory
This machine has a `/feature-factory` skill (24 specialist subagents, tailored to THE VAULT) that builds a feature end-to-end. See the maintainer's Claude memory for the roster.
